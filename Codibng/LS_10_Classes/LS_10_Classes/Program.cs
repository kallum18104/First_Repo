            Lesson 10 Classes-

            Welcome to lesson 10 Classes.

            Classes are the next level up from functions.

            A class is a datatype that you define and give it its own functions and variables.

            The basic syntax to define a class is:

             class YourClass
            {
               
            }

            To create a variable that uses your newly defined datatype you do:

            YourClass Classvariable= new YourClass();

            To give your class a member variable you do:

             class YourClass
            {
               public int Class_int;
            }
            
            A member within a class can be either public, private or protected 
            (Dont worry about protected for now)

            A public member is something that can be accessed by any variable using its class.

            A private member can only be accessed by the class itself rather than any variable 
            using its datatype.
            
            To give a class a function all you need to do is state whther that function is public or private 
            inside the function:

             class YourClass
            {
               public int Class_int;

                public void myFunction()
                {
                    //Do code here
                }
            }

            To access a member within the class (assuming its public) you do:

            YourClass Classvariable= new YourClass();

            Classvariable.myFunction();
            Classvariable.Class_int;

            
            
         */

        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
          //  Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");

            MyClass YourClass= new MyClass();

            YourClass.my_int = 7;

          //  Console.WriteLine(YourClass.my_int);

           YourClass.rndNum();

            newClass myClass = new newClass();

            myClass.myInt = 6;

           // myClass.newClassFunction();
        }

        class newClass
        {
            public int myInt;

            public void newClassFunction()
            {
                Console.WriteLine("I am being spat out by newClassFunction!");
            }
        }
        class MyClass
        {
            public int my_int;
            public string class_string;
            private int class_int;

            public void myFunc()
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Call Function");
            }

            public void class_function()
            {
                class_int += 1;
                Console.WriteLine(class_int);
                class_function();
                
            }

            public void rndNum()
            {
                Random r = new Random();
                int newInt = r.Next(1, 10);                
                Console.WriteLine(newInt);
            }
 
        }
